            Hi there. I'm uglyluigi. I am a professional full stack software developer.
            I have done front-end work in the financial tech industry in addition to
            full stack maintenance work for Sandia National Labs. This is not to mention my
            work as a hobbyist programmer, which you can view on my GitHub page.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may be wondering: "why is your personal site not fully 3D/using WebAssembly/(etc.)?"
            The answer is simple: less is more. Also, I'm already using Vue, Tailwind and ASP.NET.
            Not exactly starting from scratch over here!
        </p>
